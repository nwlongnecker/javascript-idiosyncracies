# javascript-idiosyncracies
This repository contains a collection of sample scripts that showcase unique and sometimes surprising JavaScript behavior. The intended audience is Java or C# devs who are not very familiar with JavaScript.

Scripts in this repo are organized into bite-sized 'lessons', each focused on a specific key takeaway about JavaScript's functionality. Mostly, one can jump around between the lessons however they like, as most of the lessons are standalone, but there are two sequences that should be looked at together:

* Lessons 6-10 focus on classes. Classes in JavaScript do not have all the same guarantees about consistency and integrity that one might expect coming from an object oriented language. These lessons demonstrate some examples of how integrity guarantees one might expect of classes can easily be foiled in JavaScript. The key takeaway from these lessons are that JavaScript classes are different from Java or C# classes, and illustrate why most JavaScript devs choose not to use classes at all.
* Lessons 11-13 focus on async programming and build on each other. These lessons review the three paradigms for async programming in JavaScript and each solve the same problem using different paradigms to demonstrate the differences between them.
