/*
 * In JavaScript, there are three ways to handle asynchronous programming: callbacks, promises, and async/await.
 * Async/await is the newest and is easiest to use and therefore generally preferred,
 * but knowlege of the others is helpful because those patterns still exist in the wild.
 * 
 * Async/await is the preferred way to handle asynchronous programming: it provides the most natural syntax,
 * has the fewest pitfalls, and allows you to do error handling using the familiar try/catch pattern.
